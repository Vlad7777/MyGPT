"""
Monte Carlo simulation is a technique used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot be easily predicted due to the intervention of random variables. In Python, you can implement Monte Carlo simulations using NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for visualization. Here's a simple example of a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of π (pi):

python
Copy code

"""

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Number of random points to generate
num_points = 1000

# Generate random points within a square
points = np.random.rand(num_points, 2)

# Check if each point is within the unit circle
inside_circle = np.linalg.norm(points, axis=1) <= 1

# Estimate the value of pi
pi_estimate = 4 * np.sum(inside_circle) / num_points

# Visualize the results
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.scatter(points[:, 0], points[:, 1], c=inside_circle, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.5)
plt.title(f'Monte Carlo Simulation for π: {pi_estimate:.4f}')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.show()

"""
This example generates random points within a square and checks if each point is inside the unit circle by calculating its Euclidean distance from the origin. The ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points is used to estimate the value of π.

You can adapt this concept to model various real-world scenarios or financial instruments by defining appropriate rules for the simulation. Monte Carlo simulations are widely used in finance, engineering, physics, and other fields to model systems with uncertainty.

Note: The accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations improves as you increase the number of random points generated, but it's important to keep in mind that Monte Carlo simulations are stochastic and results can vary.
