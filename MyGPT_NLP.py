"""
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. Python offers several libraries and tools for NLP tasks. Here are some key libraries and a brief overview of common NLP tasks:

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):

NLTK is a powerful library for working with human language data.
It provides tools for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.

spaCy:

spaCy is a modern NLP library with pre-trained models for various languages.
It's designed for efficiency and scalability, making it suitable for real-world applications.

TextBlob:

TextBlob is a simple library for processing textual data.
It provides easy-to-use interfaces for common NLP tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and more.

Gensim:

Gensim is a library for topic modeling and document similarity analysis.
It includes implementations of algorithms like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and Word2Vec.

Transformers (Hugging Face):

The Transformers library from Hugging Face provides pre-trained models for a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification, named entity recognition, and question-answering.
It is built on the PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks.

Stanford NLP:

Stanford NLP tools offer a suite of NLP tools, including part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more.
They are implemented in Java but have Python wrappers.

"""

import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk import pos_tag

nltk.download('punkt')

text = "Natural Language Processing is fascinating!"

# Tokenization
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

# Part-of-speech tagging
pos_tags = pos_tag(tokens)

print("Tokens:", tokens)
print("Part-of-speech tags:", pos_tags)
#This is just a basic introduction, and NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text summarization, and machine translation, among others. Depending on your specific needs, you may choose different libraries and tools for your NLP projects.
