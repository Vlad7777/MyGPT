#MyGPT_Surrogate-AssistedOptimization

"""
Surrogate-assisted optimization involves using surrogate models to approximate the objective function and constraints, which can be particularly useful when the real objective function is expensive to evaluate. In Python, the scikit-optimize library provides a convenient framework for surrogate-assisted optimization. Below is an example using Gaussian Process Regression as a surrogate model:

python
"""
# See https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/_modules/ray/tune/search/skopt/skopt_search.html


from skopt import gp_minimize
from skopt.space import Real
import numpy as np

# Define the expensive objective function
def true_objective(x):
    return (x[0] - 2) ** 2 + (x[1] + 1) ** 2

# Define the surrogate model objective function
def surrogate_objective(x):
    # You can use a Gaussian Process model as a surrogate
    return surrogate_model.predict(np.array([x]), return_std=False)[0]

# Generate some initial random points for evaluation
initial_points = np.random.rand(5, 2) * 10 - 5  # Assuming a 2-dimensional space

# Evaluate the true objective function at the initial points
initial_values = [true_objective(x) for x in initial_points]

# Specify the optimization space
space = [Real(-5, 5, name='x0'), Real(-5, 5, name='x1')]

# Define the surrogate-assisted optimization objective function
def surrogate_assisted_objective(x):
    return surrogate_objective(x)

# Perform the surrogate-assisted optimization using Gaussian Process Regression
result = gp_minimize(surrogate_assisted_objective, space, x0=initial_points, y0=initial_values, n_calls=10)

# Print the result
print("Optimal solution:", result.x)
print("Optimal objective value:", result.fun)

"""
In this example, the true objective function is represented by true_objective, and a surrogate model is constructed using Gaussian Process Regression through the gp_minimize function from scikit-optimize. The surrogate model is then used to minimize the surrogate_assisted_objective function, which approximates the true objective function.

Make sure to adjust the objective function, space definition, and other parameters according to your specific problem. The skopt library supports various surrogate models, acquisition functions, and optimization strategies. Refer to the scikit-optimize documentation for more details and options.
