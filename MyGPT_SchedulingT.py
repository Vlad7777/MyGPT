"""
Scheduling theory involves the study and optimization of the order and timing of tasks to accomplish specific objectives efficiently. Python offers various libraries and tools for solving scheduling problems. Below, I'll provide a simple example using the ortools library for solving a job scheduling problem.

First, make sure to install the ortools library:

bash
Copy code
pip install ortools
Now, let's consider a simple job scheduling problem where each job has a processing time, and the goal is to minimize the total completion time:

python
Copy code
"""

from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

def job_scheduling():
    model = cp_model.CpModel()

    # Job data (job_id, processing_time)
    jobs = [(0, 3), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 8), (4, 4)]

    # Variables
    horizon = sum(job[1] for job in jobs)
    start_vars = [model.NewIntVar(0, horizon, f'start_{job[0]}') for job in jobs]

    # Constraints
    for i in range(1, len(jobs)):
        model.Add(start_vars[i] >= start_vars[i - 1] + jobs[i - 1][1])

    # Objective
    model.Minimize(start_vars[-1] + jobs[-1][1])

    # Solve the model
    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    status = solver.Solve(model)

    # Print the results
    if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL:
        print('Optimal Schedule:')
        for i, job in enumerate(jobs):
            start_time = solver.Value(start_vars[i])
            end_time = start_time + job[1]
            print(f'Job {job[0]} starts at {start_time} and ends at {end_time}')
        print(f'Total completion time: {solver.ObjectiveValue()}')
    else:
        print('No optimal solution found.')

# Run the job scheduling example
job_scheduling()

"""
In this example:

We use the ortools.sat.python.cp_model module to create a constraint programming (CP) model.
The jobs are represented by tuples (job_id, processing_time).
Variables represent the start times of each job, and constraints ensure that jobs are scheduled in the correct order.
The objective is to minimize the completion time of the last job.
This is a simplified example, and the ortools library supports more complex scheduling scenarios and constraints. You can adapt this code to suit your specific scheduling problem by modifying the job data and constraints accordingly.
