"""
Markov Chains are stochastic models used to describe a sequence of events where the probability of each event depends only on the state of the system in the previous step. Python provides various libraries that make it easy to implement and analyze Markov Chains. Below is a basic example using NumPy:

python
Copy code
"""

import numpy as np

# Define the transition matrix
transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.2, 0.8]])

# Initial state
current_state = np.array([0.6, 0.4])

# Number of steps
num_steps = 10

# Simulate the Markov Chain
for _ in range(num_steps):
    # Perform the state transition
    current_state = np.dot(current_state, transition_matrix)

    # Print the current state
    print("Current State:", current_state)

    """
In this example:

transition_matrix represents the probabilities of transitioning between different states. Each row corresponds to the probabilities of transitioning from the current state to all possible next states.
current_state represents the initial state probabilities.
np.dot(current_state, transition_matrix) calculates the next state probabilities based on the current state and the transition matrix.
You can extend this example to analyze longer sequences, calculate steady-state probabilities, or incorporate more complex transitions.

If you're interested in a more extensive library for working with Markov Chains, you may consider using the pymc3 library. Below is a simple example using pymc3 to simulate a Markov Chain:

python
Copy code
"""

import pymc3 as pm

# Define the transition matrix
transition_matrix = np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.2, 0.8]])

# Number of steps
num_steps = 10

# Create a PyMC3 model
with pm.Model() as model:
    # Define the state variable
    state = pm.Categorical("state", p=np.array([0.6, 0.4]), shape=num_steps)

    # Define the transition probabilities
    probabilities = pm.math.switch(state, transition_matrix[0, :], transition_matrix[1, :])

    # Simulate the Markov Chain
    observed_states = pm.Categorical("observed_states", p=probabilities, observed=np.zeros(num_steps))

# Perform sampling
with model:
    trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=500, chains=1)

# Print the trace
print(trace["state"])
#This example uses pymc3 to define a categorical variable representing the state and uses a switch function to choose the appropriate transition probabilities based on the current state. The resulting trace provides samples from the Markov Chain.
