For non-linear programming and convex optimization in Python, the scipy.optimize module provides a variety of algorithms. One commonly used algorithm for convex optimization is the Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP) algorithm. Here's a simple example:

python
Copy code
"""


from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2  # Example: minimize x^2 + y^2

# Define the constraints
def constraint1(x):
    return x[0] + x[1] - 1  # Example constraint: x + y >= 1

# Set initial guess
initial_guess = [0.5, 0.5]

# Define the bounds for variables
bounds = ((0, None), (0, None))  # Non-negative variables

# Define the constraints
constraints = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint1})

# Perform optimization using SLSQP
result = minimize(objective_function, initial_guess, method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)

# Print the result
print("Optimal values:", result.x)
print("Optimal objective value:", result.fun)

"""
In this example:

The objective_function is the function to be minimized. In this case, it's 
�
2
+
�
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 .
The constraint1 is an inequality constraint. In this case, it's 
�
+
�
≥
1
x+y≥1.
The initial_guess is the initial guess for the optimization variables.
The bounds define constraints on variable values. In this case, it specifies that both variables should be non-negative.
The constraints specify the constraints on the variables. In this case, it's an inequality constraint.
You can customize the objective function, constraints, and bounds based on your specific problem. Additionally, there are other optimization algorithms available in scipy.optimize that you can explore based on your needs.

Keep in mind that the success of optimization depends on the nature of your problem and the choice of optimization method. Always refer to the documentation for detailed information:
