"""
Lean Six Sigma is a combination of Lean principles and Six Sigma methodologies, aiming to improve business processes by eliminating waste and reducing variation. Python can be a valuable tool for Lean Six Sigma practitioners, allowing them to conduct statistical analysis, visualize data, and implement various improvement techniques. Here are some ways Python can be applied in a Lean Six Sigma context:

1. Data Collection and Analysis with Pandas:
Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, and it's well-suited for collecting and analyzing data.

python
Copy code
"""

import pandas as pd

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Perform data analysis
mean_value = df['column_name'].mean()
std_dev = df['column_name'].std()

"""
# Display basic statistics
print(f'Mean: {mean_value}, Standard Deviation: {std_dev}')
2. Process Mapping and Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn:
Matplotlib and Seaborn are useful for creating visualizations, which can aid in process mapping and understanding process performance.

python
Copy code
"""


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Example process mapping
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(x='process_step', data=df)
plt.title('Process Step Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Process Step')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()

"""
3. Statistical Analysis with SciPy:
SciPy provides various statistical tests and functions that can be used for hypothesis testing and analyzing process performance.

python
Copy code
"""


from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Example t-test
group1 = df[df['group'] == 'A']['value']
group2 = df[df['group'] == 'B']['value']

statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(group1, group2)
print(f'T-Test Statistic: {statistic}, P-value: {p_value}')

"""
4. Process Improvement with Optimization Libraries:
Optimization libraries like scipy.optimize can be used for process improvement, such as finding optimal parameter values.

python
Copy code
"""

from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Example optimization
def objective_function(x):
    # Your objective function
    return ...

result = minimize(objective_function, initial_guess)
print(f'Optimal parameters: {result.x}')

"""
5. Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics:
Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that can be used for predictive analytics, helping to predict outcomes and identify factors influencing process performance.

python
Copy code
"""

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Example linear regression
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
#These examples highlight how Python, along with various libraries, can be used in different aspects of Lean Six Sigma, from data analysis and visualization to statistical analysis and process improvement. The specific application will depend on the goals of your Lean Six Sigma project and the nature of your processes.
