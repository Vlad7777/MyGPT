#MyGPT_RegressionEquation 

"""
Creating a regression equation in Python typically involves using a machine learning library, such as scikit-learn, to train a regression model. I'll provide an example using linear regression, but keep in mind that depending on your data and the problem, you might want to explore other regression techniques (e.g., polynomial regression, ridge regression, lasso regression).

Here's a simple example using scikit-learn for linear regression:


"""
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some example data
np.random.seed(42)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Print the coefficients of the regression equation (slope and intercept)
slope = model.coef_[0][0]
intercept = model.intercept_[0]
print(f'Regression Equation: y = {slope:.2f} * X + {intercept:.2f}')

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Visualize the regression line
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='black', label='Actual')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='blue', linewidth=3, label='Regression Line')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

"""
In this example, we generate synthetic data and fit a linear regression model to it. The regression equation is printed, and a scatter plot with the regression line is visualized. Replace the X and y arrays with your own data.

Remember to adapt the code according to the specific characteristics and requirements of your dataset. For more complex scenarios, you might need to consider feature scaling, handling categorical variables, and exploring other regression techniques.
