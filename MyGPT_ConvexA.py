"""
Convex analysis involves studying convex sets and functions, which are fundamental concepts in optimization. Python provides several libraries for convex optimization and analysis. One popular library is cvxpy. Here's a simple example demonstrating convex analysis using cvxpy:

First, install the library:

bash
Copy code
pip install cvxpy
Now, let's consider a basic convex optimization problem:

python
Copy code
"""


import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# Create a simple convex optimization problem
x = cp.Variable()
objective = cp.Minimize(cp.square(x - 4))
problem = cp.Problem(objective)

# Solve the problem
problem.solve()

# Print the results
print("Optimal value:", problem.value)
print("Optimal solution:", x.value)

"""
In this example:

We define a convex optimization problem to minimize the square of the difference between x and 4.
The variable x is automatically treated as a real variable by default in cvxpy.
This is a basic illustration, and cvxpy supports more complex convex optimization problems with linear and quadratic objectives, as well as various constraints. Here's another example with a linear constraint:

python
Copy code
"""

# Create a convex optimization problem with a linear constraint
x = cp.Variable()
a = np.array([2])
b = np.array([1])
#constraints = [a @ x == b, x >= 0]
constraints = [a * x == b, x >= 0]


objective = cp.Minimize(cp.square(x - 4))
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

# Solve the problem
problem.solve()

# Print the results
print("Optimal value:", problem.value)
print("Optimal solution:", x.value)

"""
In this example:

We add a linear constraint a @ x == b where a is a vector and b is a scalar.
You can adapt these examples based on your specific convex analysis or optimization needs. The cvxpy library provides a clean and expressive syntax for specifying convex optimization problems.
