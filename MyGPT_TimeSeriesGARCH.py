#MyGPT_TimeSeriesGARCH

#The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is commonly used for modeling volatility in time series data. You can use the arch library in Python for implementing GARCH models. Below is an example of how to use the arch library to fit a GARCH(1,1) model to a time series in Python:


# Install the 'arch' library if you haven't already
# pip install arch

import pandas as pd
import arch
from arch import arch_model
import yfinance as yf  # You can replace this with any other method to get financial time series data

# Download historical stock prices
ticker = 'AAPL'
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2023-01-01'
data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)['Adj Close']

# Calculate daily returns
returns = data.pct_change().dropna()

# Fit a GARCH(1,1) model
model = arch_model(returns, vol='Garch', p=1, q=1)
results = model.fit()

# Display model summary
print(results.summary())

# Plot the volatility forecast
results.plot()

"""
In this example:

We use the yfinance library to download historical stock prices for a given ticker symbol (in this case, 'AAPL') within a specified date range.

Calculate the daily returns from the adjusted closing prices.

Fit a GARCH(1,1) model using the arch_model function from the arch library.

Display the summary of the model results using results.summary().

Plot the volatility forecast using results.plot().

Make sure to replace 'AAPL' with the desired ticker symbol and adjust the date range as needed.

Note: The arch library is suitable for financial time series data, but you might need to preprocess and adapt the code based on your specific requirements and dataset. Additionally, you can experiment with different GARCH specifications (changing p and q parameters) based on the characteristics of your data.
