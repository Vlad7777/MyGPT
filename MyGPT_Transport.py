#MyGPT_Transport

"""
The transportation problem is a classic optimization problem in Operations Research that involves finding the most cost-effective way to transport goods from a set of suppliers to a set of consumers, given the costs associated with each possible route. Python offers optimization libraries like scipy for solving linear programming problems, which can be applied to tackle the transportation problem.

Here is a simple example of solving a transportation problem using the scipy.optimize.linprog function:

python
Copy code
"""

import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linprog

# Define the cost matrix (costs associated with transporting from suppliers to consumers)
cost_matrix = np.array([[4, 6, 8], [8, 5, 3]])

# Define the supply and demand vectors
supply = np.array([20, 30])
demand = np.array([10, 25, 15])

# Flatten the cost matrix for linprog
c = cost_matrix.flatten()

# Define the equality constraints matrix
A_eq = []
for i in range(len(supply) + len(demand)):
    row = [0] * len(c)
    if i < len(supply):
        row[i * len(demand): (i + 1) * len(demand)] = 1
    else:
        for j in range(len(supply)):
            row[i - len(supply) + j * len(demand)] = 1
    A_eq.append(row)

# Solve the linear programming problem
result = linprog(c, A_eq=A_eq, b_eq=np.concatenate([supply, demand]))

# Reshape the solution to a matrix
transportation_matrix = np.reshape(result.x, cost_matrix.shape)

# Print the solution
print("Optimal Transportation Matrix:")
print(transportation_matrix)
print("Optimal Cost:", result.fun)

"""
In this example:

The cost_matrix represents the costs associated with transporting goods from suppliers to consumers.
The supply and demand vectors represent the supply and demand constraints.
The linear programming problem is formulated and solved using the scipy.optimize.linprog function.
Make sure to have scipy installed:

bash
Copy code

pip install scipy
This is a basic example, and you may need to adapt it to fit the specific requirements and constraints of your transportation problem.
