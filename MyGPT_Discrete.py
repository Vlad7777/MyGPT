"""
Common discrete optimization problems include the traveling salesman problem, the knapsack problem, and the job scheduling problem.

In Python, you can solve discrete optimization problems using various optimization libraries. One popular library is PuLP, which is a linear programming library that allows you to define and solve optimization problems. Here's a simple example of solving the 0/1 knapsack problem using PuLP:

python
Copy code

"""

from pulp import LpProblem, LpMaximize, LpVariable, lpSum, LpBinary

# Define the problem
knapsack_problem = LpProblem("Knapsack Problem", LpMaximize)

# Decision variables
x1 = LpVariable("x1", 0, 1, LpBinary)  # 0/1 variable for item 1
x2 = LpVariable("x2", 0, 1, LpBinary)  # 0/1 variable for item 2
x3 = LpVariable("x3", 0, 1, LpBinary)  # 0/1 variable for item 3

# Objective function
knapsack_problem += 5 * x1 + 3 * x2 + 2 * x3, "Total_Value"

# Constraint: Knapsack capacity
knapsack_problem += 2 * x1 + x2 + 4 * x3 <= 8, "Knapsack_Capacity"

# Solve the problem
knapsack_problem.solve()

# Print the results
print("Status:", LpProblem.status[knapsack_problem.status])
print("Selected items:")
for var in knapsack_problem.variables():
    print(f"{var.name}: {var.varValue}")
print("Total value:", lpSum([5 * x1.varValue, 3 * x2.varValue, 2 * x3.varValue]))

"""
In this example, we're solving a simplified 0/1 knapsack problem with three items and a constraint on the knapsack capacity. PuLP is used to define decision variables, an objective function, and constraints, and then solve the problem.

Make sure to install PuLP before running the code:

bash
Copy code
pip install pulp
