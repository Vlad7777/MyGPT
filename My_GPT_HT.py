"""
Performing hypothesis tests in Python typically involves using statistical libraries like scipy.stats or statsmodels. I'll provide a simple example of a t-test using scipy.stats and a z-test using statsmodels. Keep in mind that the choice between a t-test and a z-test depends on the sample size and the known standard deviation of the population.

T-Test using scipy.stats:
python
Copy code

"""
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Example data (replace this with your own data)
group1 = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=100)
group2 = np.random.normal(loc=12, scale=2, size=120)

# Perform a two-sample independent t-test
statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(group1, group2)

# Print the results
print(f'T-Test Statistic: {statistic}')
print(f'P-value: {p_value}')

# Interpret the results
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference between the groups.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference between the groups.")

    """
Z-Test using statsmodels:
python
Copy code

"""

import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Example data (replace this with your own data)
group1 = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=100)
group2 = np.random.normal(loc=12, scale=2, size=120)

# Perform a two-sample z-test
z_test = sm.stats.ztest(group1, group2)

# Print the results
statistic, p_value = z_test
print(f'Z-Test Statistic: {statistic}')
print(f'P-value: {p_value}')

# Interpret the results
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference between the groups.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference between the groups.")

    """
Replace the group1 and group2 arrays with your actual data. The t-test is suitable for smaller sample sizes, while the z-test is often used for larger samples when the population standard deviation is known. Ensure that the assumptions of the tests are met before interpreting the results.

Python provides several libraries for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. Some of the commonly used libraries include:

NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Website: NumPy
SciPy: SciPy builds on NumPy and provides additional functionality for scientific and technical computing. It includes modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, and more.

Website: SciPy
pandas: pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures like DataFrames for efficient data manipulation and analysis tools for tasks such as grouping, aggregation, and handling missing data.

Website: pandas
statsmodels: statsmodels is a library for estimating and testing statistical models. It includes various statistical models, hypothesis tests, and data exploration tools.

Website: statsmodels
scikit-learn: scikit-learn is a machine learning library, but it also includes modules for various statistical techniques, such as clustering, regression, and dimensionality reduction.

Website: scikit-learn
matplotlib and seaborn: These libraries are used for data visualization. While not statistical analysis libraries per se, they are crucial for visualizing data distributions, relationships, and patterns.

Websites: matplotlib, seaborn
scipy.stats: This module within SciPy contains a wide range of statistical functions and tests, including t-tests, ANOVA, correlation tests, and more.

Documentation: scipy.stats
pyMC3: If you're interested in Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming, pyMC3 is a popular library. It allows you to build probabilistic models using a syntax inspired by the probabilistic programming language.

Website: pyMC3
These libraries cover a wide range of statistical methods, from basic descriptive statistics to advanced modeling and hypothesis testing. Depending on your specific needs, you may choose one or more of these libraries for your statistical analysis in Python.
