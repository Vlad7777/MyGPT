"""
Optimizing Return on Investment (ROI) often involves making decisions about resource allocation, budgeting, and project prioritization to maximize the return on resources invested. Python can be a valuable tool for performing these optimizations. Here are some common approaches:

Linear Programming with PuLP:
PuLP is a linear programming library that can be used for optimization problems with linear constraints.

python
Copy code
"""

from pulp import LpMaximize, LpProblem, LpVariable

# Create a LP maximization problem
model = LpProblem(name="ROI_Optimization", sense=LpMaximize)

# Define decision variables
x1 = LpVariable(name="project1", lowBound=0)
x2 = LpVariable(name="project2", lowBound=0)

# Define the objective function
model += 10 * x1 + 15 * x2, "Total ROI"

# Define constraints
model += 2 * x1 + 3 * x2 <= 30
model += 4 * x1 + 2 * x2 <= 28

# Solve the optimization problem
model.solve()

# Print the results
print("Optimal value for project1:", x1.value())
print("Optimal value for project2:", x2.value())
print("Total ROI:", model.objective.value())

"""
This is a simple example. You would need to adjust the objective function and constraints based on the specific details of your ROI optimization problem.

Non-linear Optimization with Scipy:
Scipy's optimization module provides functions for non-linear optimization problems.

python
Copy code
"""

from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function to maximize
def objective(x):
    return -(10 * x[0] + 15 * x[1])

# Define constraints
constraints = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 30 - (2 * x[0] + 3 * x[1])},
               {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 28 - (4 * x[0] + 2 * x[1])})

# Initial guess
x0 = [0, 0]

# Perform optimization
result = minimize(objective, x0, constraints=constraints, method='SLSQP')

# Print the results
print("Optimal values for projects:", result.x)
print("Total ROI:", -result.fun)

"""
Monte Carlo Simulation for Risk Analysis:
Monte Carlo simulations can be used to assess the impact of uncertainty on ROI.

python
Copy code
"""

import numpy as np

# Define a function to simulate ROI
def simulate_roi(project1, project2):
    # Simulate uncertain factors
    factor1 = np.random.normal(loc=1, scale=0.1)
    factor2 = np.random.normal(loc=1, scale=0.2)

    # Simulate ROI based on uncertain factors
    roi = (project1 * factor1) * 10 + (project2 * factor2) * 15

    return roi

# Perform Monte Carlo simulation
num_simulations = 1000
project1_values = np.random.uniform(0, 10, num_simulations)
project2_values = np.random.uniform(0, 10, num_simulations)

# Calculate simulated ROIs
simulated_rois = [simulate_roi(p1, p2) for p1, p2 in zip(project1_values, project2_values)]

# Analyze results (mean, confidence intervals, etc.)
mean_roi = np.mean(simulated_rois)
confidence_interval = np.percentile(simulated_rois, [2.5, 97.5])

print(f"Mean ROI: {mean_roi}")
print(f"95% Confidence Interval: {confidence_interval}")
#These are just examples, and the specific approach you take will depend on the details of your ROI optimization problem. Whether linear programming, non-linear optimization, or simulation is appropriate depends on the nature of your constraints and the level of uncertainty in your problem.
