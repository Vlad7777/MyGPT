#MyGPT_HeuristicAlgorithms

"""
Heuristic algorithms are problem-solving approaches that prioritize finding good (though not necessarily optimal) solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Python provides various libraries and modules that can be used to implement heuristic algorithms. Here are some common heuristic algorithms and examples of their implementations in Python:

Genetic Algorithm:

Genetic algorithms are optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They evolve a population of candidate solutions over multiple generations.
Example using the genetic library:

"""


#from genetic import GeneticAlgorithm

import GeneticAlgorithm as ga

# Define the fitness function
def fitness_function(solution):
    return sum(solution)

# Create and run the genetic algorithm
ga = GeneticAlgorithm(population_size=100, chromosome_length=10, fitness_function=fitness_function)
result = ga.run(max_generations=100)

print("Best Solution:", result.solution)

"""
Simulated Annealing:

Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It explores the solution space and accepts worse solutions with a decreasing probability.
Example using the simanneal library:

"""

from simanneal import Annealer

# Define the problem
class ExampleProblem(Annealer):
    def move(self):
        # Implement how to change the solution
        pass

    def energy(self):
        # Define the objective function (to be minimized)
        pass

# Create and run the simulated annealing algorithm
problem = ExampleProblem(initial_state=[...])
state, energy = problem.anneal()

print("Best Solution:", state)

"""
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):

PSO is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds or fish. Particles move through the solution space searching for the best solution.
Example using the pyswarms library:
python
Copy code

"""

import numpy as np
from pyswarms.single import GlobalBestPSO

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(position):
    return np.sum(position**2)

# Create and run the PSO algorithm
options = {'c1': 0.5, 'c2': 0.3, 'w': 0.9}
optimizer = GlobalBestPSO(n_particles=10, dimensions=2, options=options)
best_position, _ = optimizer.optimize(objective_function, iters=100)

print("Best Solution:", best_position)

"""
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):

ACO is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It is used to find good paths through graphs or networks.
Example using the ant_colony library:
python
Copy code
"""

from ant_colony import AntColony

# Define the graph and distances between nodes
graph = {...}  # Define your graph
distances = {...}  # Define distances between nodes

# Create and run the ACO algorithm
ant_colony = AntColony(graph, distances, n_ants=10, max_iter=100, alpha=1.0, beta=2.0)
best_path = ant_colony.run()

print("Best Path:", best_path)


#Please note that these are simplified examples, and you might need to adapt them to your specific problem and requirements. Additionally, you may need to install the respective libraries (genetic, simanneal, pyswarms, ant_colony) using tools like pip before running the code.
