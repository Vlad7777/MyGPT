"""
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a popular machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. In Python, the scikit-learn library provides an implementation of SVM. Here's a basic example of using SVM for classification:

python
Copy code

"""

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load the Iris dataset (a well-known dataset for classification)
iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create an SVM classifier
svm_classifier = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0, random_state=42)

# Train the classifier on the training data
svm_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = svm_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the classifier
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Display classification report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

"""
In this example:

The Iris dataset is split into training and testing sets.
An SVM classifier is created using SVC from scikit-learn.
The classifier is trained on the training data using the fit method.
Predictions are made on the test data, and accuracy is calculated.
Make sure to have scikit-learn installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install scikit-learn
You can customize the example based on your specific dataset and classification task. SVM allows for different kernel functions (linear, poly, rbf, etc.) and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
