"""
Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is a statistical model used for forecasting time series data that exhibits both trend and seasonality. It is an extension of the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which is commonly used for forecasting non-seasonal time series data. SARIMA models are particularly useful for forecasting time series data that exhibits regular patterns throughout the year, such as monthly sales figures or daily temperature data.

The SARIMA model is specified using four parameters:

p: The number of autoregressive (AR) terms
d: The number of differencing (I) terms
q: The number of moving average (MA) terms
P: The number of seasonal autoregressive (SAR) terms
D: The number of seasonal differencing (SI) terms
Q: The number of seasonal moving average (SMA) terms
The period of seasonality is denoted by an integer s. For example, if the data exhibits monthly seasonality, then s would be equal to 12.

The SARIMA model can be interpreted as follows:

The AR terms represent the relationship between the current value of the time series and its past values.

The I terms represent the number of times the time series has been differenced to make it stationary. Stationarity is a property of time series data that means that the mean, variance, and autocorrelation do not change over time.

The MA terms represent the relationship between the current value of the time series and the errors of previous forecasts.

The SAR terms represent the relationship between the current value of the time series and its past seasonal values.

The SI terms represent the number of times the time series has been seasonally differenced to make it stationary. Stationarity is a property of time series data that means that the mean, variance, and autocorrelation do not change over time.

The SMA terms represent the relationship between the current value of the time series and the errors of previous seasonal forecasts.

SARIMA models can be estimated using various statistical methods, such as maximum likelihood estimation and least squares estimation. However, the most common method for estimating SARIMA models in Python is using the SARIMAX class from the statsmodels library.

Here is an example of how to estimate a SARIMA model in Python:

Python

"""

import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX

# Load the time series data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Define the SARIMA model
model = SARIMAX(data['y'], order=(p, d, q), seasonal_order=(P, D, Q, s))

# Estimate the SARIMA model
model_fit = model.fit()

# Make predictions for the next 10 periods
predictions = model_fit.forecast(10)

print(predictions)

This code will load time series data from a CSV file named data.csv, estimate a SARIMA model, and make predictions for the next 10 periods. The predictions will be printed to the console.

SARIMA models are a powerful tool for forecasting time series data that exhibits both trend and seasonality. They are commonly used in a variety of applications, such as forecasting sales figures, predicting customer behavior, and optimizing resource allocation.

Here is an example of how to fit a SARIMA model to a time series of daily sales data:

Python

"""

import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('sales.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)

# Create the SARIMA model
model = SARIMAX(data['Sales'], order=(1, 1, 1), seasonal_order=(1, 1, 1, 12))

# Fit the model to the data
model_fit = model.fit()

# Make predictions for the next 30 days
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=30)

This code will fit a SARIMA model to the daily sales data and make predictions for the next 30 days. The predictions can be plotted using Matplotlib.

Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the actual and predicted sales
plt.plot(data['Sales'], label='Actual')
plt.plot(forecast, label='Predicted')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

This code will plot the actual daily sales data and the predicted sales for the next 30 days. The plot will show how well the SARIMA model is able to forecast the future sales.
