#MyGPT_AugmentedLagrangianMethods

"""
Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM) are optimization techniques used to solve constrained optimization problems. These methods combine penalty terms with Lagrange multipliers to handle both equality and inequality constraints. In Python, you can implement augmented Lagrangian methods using optimization libraries like scipy.optimize. Below is an example using the minimize function with the 'trust-constr' method, which supports augmented Lagrangian methods:

python
"""


from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(x):
    return (x[0] - 1)**2 + (x[1] - 2.5)**2

# Define the equality constraint
def equality_constraint(x):
    return x[0] + x[1] - 3

# Define the inequality constraint
def inequality_constraint(x):
    return x[0] - 2 * x[1] + 2

# Define the augmented Lagrangian function
def augmented_lagrangian(x, equality_penalty, inequality_penalty, lagrange_multipliers):
    eq_penalty_term = equality_penalty * equality_constraint(x)**2
    ineq_penalty_term = inequality_penalty * max(0, inequality_constraint(x))**2
    lagrangian_term = sum(lagrange_multipliers * (equality_constraint(x), max(0, inequality_constraint(x))))
    return objective_function(x) + eq_penalty_term + ineq_penalty_term + lagrangian_term

# Initial guess
initial_guess = [0, 0]

# Penalty weights
equality_penalty_weight = 10.0
inequality_penalty_weight = 10.0

# Lagrange multipliers
initial_lagrangian_multipliers = [0.0, 0.0]

# Run the optimizer with augmented Lagrangian method
result = minimize(lambda x: augmented_lagrangian(x, equality_penalty_weight, inequality_penalty_weight, initial_lagrangian_multipliers),
                  initial_guess,
                  method='trust-constr',
                  constraints=[
                      {'type': 'eq', 'fun': equality_constraint},
                      {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': inequality_constraint}
                  ])

# Print the result
print("Optimal solution:", result.x)
print("Optimal objective value:", result.fun)

"""
In this example, the augmented_lagrangian function combines the objective function with penalty terms and the Lagrangian term. The minimize function is then used with the 'trust-constr' method, which supports constrained optimization using augmented Lagrangian methods. The constraints are specified using dictionaries representing equality and inequality constraints.

Adjust the objective function, constraints, initial guess, and other parameters based on your specific optimization problem. The penalty weights and Lagrange multipliers may need to be tuned based on the characteristics of your problem.
