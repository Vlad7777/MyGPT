"""
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process of converting images of text into machine-encoded text. Python provides several libraries and tools for OCR. One popular library is Tesseract, developed by Google. Below is an example using the pytesseract wrapper for Tesseract and the Pillow library for image processing:

First, install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code


pip install pytesseract Pillow
Ensure you have Tesseract installed on your system. You can download it from the official Tesseract GitHub repository.

Here's a simple example of using OCR in Python:

python
Copy code

"""

from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

# Path to the Tesseract executable (change it based on your installation)
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'

# Load an image using Pillow (PIL)
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.png'
image = Image.open(image_path)

# Perform OCR on the image
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

# Print the extracted text
print("Extracted Text:\n", text)

"""
Replace 'path/to/your/image.png' with the path to your image file.

Note:

Tesseract supports various languages, and you can specify the language using the lang parameter in image_to_string.
For better OCR results, you may need to preprocess the image, such as resizing, converting to grayscale, or enhancing contrast.
python
Copy code
"""

# Example image preprocessing
preprocessed_image = image.convert('L')  # Convert to grayscale
preprocessed_image = preprocessed_image.resize((300, 300))  # Resize
preprocessed_image.show()

# Perform OCR on the preprocessed image
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(preprocessed_image)
print("Extracted Text:\n", text)
#OCR performance can vary based on image quality, font, and other factors. Experiment with preprocessing steps and Tesseract parameters to achieve better results for your specific use case. Additionally, there are other OCR libraries and tools available, such as pytesseract and easyocr, that you can explore based on your requirements.
