#MyGPT_PenaltyMethods

"""
Penalty methods are optimization techniques used to handle constrained optimization problems by adding penalty terms to the objective function for violating constraints. In Python, you can implement penalty methods using optimization libraries like scipy.optimize. Here's an example using a basic penalty method:

python
"""


from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(x):
    return (x[0] - 1)**2 + (x[1] - 2.5)**2

# Define the equality constraint
def equality_constraint(x):
    return x[0] + x[1] - 3

# Define the inequality constraint
def inequality_constraint(x):
    return x[0] - 2 * x[1] + 2

# Define the penalty function
def penalty_function(x, equality_penalty, inequality_penalty):
    eq_penalty_term = equality_penalty * max(0, equality_constraint(x))**2
    ineq_penalty_term = inequality_penalty * max(0, inequality_constraint(x))**2
    return objective_function(x) + eq_penalty_term + ineq_penalty_term

# Initial guess
initial_guess = [0, 0]

# Penalty weights
equality_penalty_weight = 10.0
inequality_penalty_weight = 10.0

# Run the optimizer with penalty method
result = minimize(lambda x: penalty_function(x, equality_penalty_weight, inequality_penalty_weight), initial_guess)

# Print the result
print("Optimal solution:", result.x)
print("Optimal objective value:", result.fun)

"""
In this example, we've defined a penalty function that includes penalty terms for both equality and inequality constraints. The penalty terms are multiplied by penalty weights (equality_penalty_weight and inequality_penalty_weight). These weights control the strength of the penalty for violating constraints. The minimize function is then used to find the optimal solution by minimizing the penalty function.

Note that penalty methods have some drawbacks, such as sensitivity to the choice of penalty parameters and potential numerical instability. More advanced penalty methods, like augmented Lagrangian methods, can be used to address some of these issues. However, these methods are more complex to implement.

For more sophisticated implementations, you may want to explore optimization libraries that support penalty methods or augmented Lagrangian methods directly.
