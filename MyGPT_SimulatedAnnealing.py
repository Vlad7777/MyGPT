#MyGPT_SimulatedAnnealing

#Simulated annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It is used to find an approximate solution to an optimization problem. The idea is to start with a random solution and iteratively refine it by accepting probabilistically worse solutions. This allows the algorithm to escape local optima and explore the solution space more broadly.

#Here's a simple example of simulated annealing in Python:


import math
import random

# Define the objective function to be minimized
def objective_function(x):
    return math.sin(x) + math.sin(2 * x)

# Simulated annealing function
def simulated_annealing(initial_solution, objective_function, max_iterations, temperature, cooling_rate):
    current_solution = initial_solution
    current_energy = objective_function(current_solution)

    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        # Generate a new solution by perturbing the current solution
        new_solution = current_solution + random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
        new_energy = objective_function(new_solution)

        # Accept the new solution with a probability based on the energy difference
        if new_energy < current_energy or random.random() < math.exp((current_energy - new_energy) / temperature):
            current_solution = new_solution
            current_energy = new_energy

        # Cool down the temperature
        temperature *= cooling_rate

    return current_solution, current_energy

# Set parameters
initial_solution = 2.0
max_iterations = 1000
temperature = 1.0
cooling_rate = 0.95

# Run simulated annealing
final_solution, final_energy = simulated_annealing(initial_solution, objective_function, max_iterations, temperature, cooling_rate)

# Print the result
print(f"Final solution: {final_solution}")
print(f"Final energy: {final_energy}")


#This example minimizes the objective_function, which is the sum of two sine functions. You can replace the objective function with your own function that you want to minimize. The simulated_annealing function takes the initial solution, objective function, maximum number of iterations, initial temperature, and cooling rate as parameters.

#Keep in mind that the effectiveness of simulated annealing depends on the problem at hand and the choice of parameters. Adjusting parameters such as temperature and cooling rate may be necessary for different optimization problems.
