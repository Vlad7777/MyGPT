"""

A finite state machine (FSM) is a mathematical model of computation that describes a system's behavior over time. It is composed of a set of states, a set of transitions between states, and a set of actions that are performed when transitions occur. FSMs are used to model a wide variety of systems, including computer programs, traffic lights, and vending machines.

In Python, there are several libraries that can be used to implement FSMs. One popular library is python-statemachine. This library provides a simple and intuitive API for defining and using FSMs.

Here is an example of how to use the python-statemachine library to implement a simple FSM that represents a vending machine:

Python

"""

from statemachine import StateMachine

class VendingMachineFSM(StateMachine):
    states = {
        'idle': {
            'insert_money': 'waiting_for_selection',
        },
        'waiting_for_selection': {
            'select_item': 'dispensing',
            'insert_more_money': 'idle',
        },
        'dispensing': {
            'dispense_item': 'dispensing',
            'give_change': 'idle',
        },
    }

    initial = 'idle'

    def on_enter(self, from_state, event):
        if from_state == 'idle' and event == 'insert_money':
            print('Money inserted')
        elif from_state == 'waiting_for_selection' and event == 'select_item':
            print('Item selected')
        elif from_state == 'dispensing' and event == 'dispense_item':
            print('Item dispensed')
        elif from_state == 'dispensing' and event == 'give_change':
            print('Change given')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fsm = VendingMachineFSM()
    fsm.run('insert_money')
    fsm.run('select_item')
    fsm.run('dispense_item')
    fsm.run('give_change')


"""
This code will print the following output:

Money inserted
Item selected
Item dispensed
Change given
As you can see, the FSM starts in the idle state, then transitions to the waiting_for_selection state when money is inserted. The user then selects an item, and the FSM transitions to the dispensing state. The item is dispensed, and the FSM transitions to the idle state again. Finally, the user is given their change, and the FSM terminates.

FSMs are a powerful tool for modeling systems with complex behavior. They are easy to understand and implement, and they can be used to model a wide variety of real-world systems.
