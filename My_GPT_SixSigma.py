"""
Six Sigma is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement and quality management. It aims to improve process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects and variability. Python, being a versatile programming language, can be used to implement various statistical and data analysis tools relevant to Six Sigma methodologies. Here are some common tasks related to Six Sigma that you can perform in Python:

1. Data Analysis with Pandas:
Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It can be used for tasks such as importing data, cleaning, and organizing datasets.

python
Copy code

"""

import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Perform data exploration and analysis
# Example: Display basic statistics
print(df.describe())

"""
2. Descriptive Statistics with NumPy:
NumPy is a library for numerical operations in Python. It's commonly used for calculating basic statistics.

python
Copy code
"""

import numpy as np

# Calculate mean, standard deviation, and other statistics
mean_value = np.mean(df['column_name'])
std_dev = np.std(df['column_name'])

print(f'Mean: {mean_value}, Standard Deviation: {std_dev}')

"""
3. Control Charts with Matplotlib:
Matplotlib is a popular library for creating visualizations. Control charts are widely used in Six Sigma to monitor and control the stability of processes.

python
Copy code

"""


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example control chart
plt.plot(df['time'], df['process_metric'], marker='o')
plt.axhline(y=mean_value, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Mean')
plt.title('Control Chart')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Process Metric')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

"""
4. Statistical Tests with SciPy:
SciPy is a library for scientific computing in Python. It includes statistical tests that can be used in Six Sigma projects.

python
Copy code
"""


from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Example t-test
group1 = df[df['group'] == 'A']['value']
group2 = df[df['group'] == 'B']['value']

statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(group1, group2)
print(f'T-Test Statistic: {statistic}, P-value: {p_value}')

"""
5. Regression Analysis with Statsmodels:
Statsmodels is a library for estimating and testing statistical models. It can be used for regression analysis.

python
Copy code
"""

import statsmodels.api as sm

# Example linear regression
X = sm.add_constant(df['independent_variable'])
model = sm.OLS(df['dependent_variable'], X).fit()
print(model.summary())
#These are just a few examples, and the specific tools and techniques you use will depend on the nature of your Six Sigma project. Remember to tailor your analysis to the characteristics of your data and the goals of your improvement efforts.
