"""
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are mathematical models used to describe decision-making in situations where the outcome is uncertain and influenced by the current state and chosen action. Python has libraries, such as gym and MDPtoolbox, that can be used for working with Markov Decision Processes.

Here's a simple example using the MDPtoolbox library to solve an MDP:

python
Copy code
"""

import numpy as np
from mdptoolbox.mdp import ValueIteration

# Define the transition probability matrix
P = np.array([[[0.5, 0.5], [0.8, 0.2]],
              [[0.9, 0.1], [0.3, 0.7]]])

# Define the reward matrix
R = np.array([[1, 0], [2, 1]])

# Create a discounted MDP
mdp = ValueIteration(P, R, discount=0.9)

# Solve the MDP
mdp.run()

# Print the optimal value function and policy
print("Optimal Value Function:")
print(mdp.V)
print("\nOptimal Policy:")
print(mdp.policy)

"""
In this example:

P is the transition probability matrix, where P[s, a, s'] represents the probability of transitioning from state s to state s' given action a.
R is the reward matrix, where R[s, a] represents the immediate reward obtained when transitioning from state s to any state with action a.
discount is the discount factor for future rewards.
Make sure to have MDPtoolbox installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install mdp-toolbox
This is a basic example, and MDPtoolbox supports more complex MDPs with various algorithms for solving them. You can customize the example by adjusting the transition probabilities, rewards, and discount factor based on your specific MDP.

If you want to work with MDPs in a reinforcement learning context, the OpenAI Gym library (gym) is a popular choice. It provides environments for testing and developing reinforcement learning algorithms:

python
Copy code
"""

import gym

# Create the FrozenLake environment
env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v1')

# Reset the environment to the initial state
state = env.reset()

# Perform random actions in the environment
for _ in range(100):
    env.render()
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

    if done:
        break

env.close()
#In this example, FrozenLake-v1 is a classic MDP environment in which an agent must navigate a frozen lake to reach a goal. You can explore and experiment with different environments provided by gym based on your MDP needs.
