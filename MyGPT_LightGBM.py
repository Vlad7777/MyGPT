#MyGPT_LightGBM

"""
LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is a gradient boosting framework that is efficient and scalable, making it well-suited for large datasets and real-time applications. It can be applied to fraud prevention by building a model that identifies patterns indicative of fraudulent activities. Here's a basic example using LightGBM in Python for fraud prevention:

Install LightGBM:
Ensure you have LightGBM installed. You can install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install lightgbm
Load and Prepare Data:
Load your dataset and prepare it for training. Make sure to have a target variable (fraud or not fraud) and features relevant to fraud detection.

Train-Test Split:
Split your data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Feature Engineering:
Create relevant features that might help in identifying fraudulent activities.

Training the LightGBM Model:
Use LightGBM to train a model on your dataset. Adjust hyperparameters based on your data and problem.

import lightgbm as lgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Assume 'X' is your feature matrix and 'y' is your target variable
# X, y = ...

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a LightGBM dataset
train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train)
test_data = lgb.Dataset(X_test, label=y_test)

# Define parameters for the LightGBM model
params = {
    'objective': 'binary',
    'metric': 'binary_logloss',
    'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
    'num_leaves': 31,
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'feature_fraction': 0.9
}

# Train the LightGBM model
num_round = 100
bst = lgb.train(params, train_data, num_round, valid_sets=[test_data], early_stopping_rounds=10)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = bst.predict(X_test, num_iteration=bst.best_iteration)
y_pred_binary = [1 if pred >= 0.5 else 0 for pred in y_pred]

# Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_binary))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred_binary))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_binary))

"""
Adjust the parameters such as num_leaves, learning_rate, and others based on your specific dataset and requirements. The early_stopping_rounds parameter helps prevent overfitting by stopping training if the performance on the validation set does not improve.

This is a basic example, and you might need to further refine the model, perform hyperparameter tuning, and consider additional techniques such as cross-validation to ensure robustness. Additionally, feature importance analysis can help you understand which features are most influential in detecting fraud.
