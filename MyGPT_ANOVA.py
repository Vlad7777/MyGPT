"""
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to analyze the differences among group means in a sample. In Python, you can perform ANOVA using the scipy.stats module or the statsmodels library. Here, I'll provide an example using both methods.

Using scipy.stats:
python
Copy code
"""

import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

# Example data (replace this with your own data)
group1 = [70, 72, 68, 75, 74]
group2 = [65, 68, 72, 70, 73]
group3 = [60, 65, 67, 63, 68]

# Perform one-way ANOVA
statistic, p_value = stats.f_oneway(group1, group2, group3)

# Print the results
print(f'ANOVA Statistic: {statistic}')
print(f'P-value: {p_value}')

# Interpret the results
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference between group means.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference between group means.")

    """
Using statsmodels:
python
Copy code

"""

import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols

# Example data (replace this with your own data)
data = {'value': group1 + group2 + group3, 'group': ['group1']*5 + ['group2']*5 + ['group3']*5}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Fit the ANOVA model
model = ols('value ~ C(group)', data=df).fit()

# Perform ANOVA
anova_table = sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)

# Print the ANOVA table
print(anova_table)

"""
In both examples, you should replace the group1, group2, and group3 lists with your actual data. The ANOVA test assesses whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of the groups.

The results include an ANOVA statistic and a p-value. If the p-value is below a chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), you may reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are significant differences between the group means.

Choose the method that best fits your needs and the structure of your data. The statsmodels approach provides more detailed statistics, while the scipy.stats approach is more straightforward for a basic ANOVA test.
