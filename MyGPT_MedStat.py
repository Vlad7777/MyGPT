    """
In this example:

Synthetic blood pressure data is generated for two treatment groups (Treatment_A and Treatment_B).
Basic statistics are displayed, and the data is visualized using a boxplot.
An independent t-test is performed to compare the mean blood pressure between the two treatments.
The results are interpreted based on a significance level of 0.05.
Note: In a real-world scenario, you would replace the synthetic data with actual medical data relevant to your study or analysis. Additionally, consider consulting with a statistician or data analyst for more complex analyses and interpretations.
