"""
Geometric programming is a type of mathematical optimization that deals with posynomial functions. The cvxpy library in Python can be used for solving geometric programming problems. Below is an example of solving a simple geometric programming problem using cvxpy:

python
Copy code
"""


import cvxpy as cp

# Variables
x = cp.Variable(pos=True)
y = cp.Variable(pos=True)

# Objective function
objective = cp.Minimize(x * y)

# Constraints
constraints = [
    2*x + 3*y >= 12,
    x + 2*y >= 6,
    x >= 1,
    y >= 1
]

# Create the problem and solve
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve()

# Print the results
print("Optimal value of x:", x.value)
print("Optimal value of y:", y.value)
print("Optimal objective value:", problem.value)

"""
In this example:

x and y are the positive variables.
The objective is to minimize the product of x and y.
There are inequality constraints defining relationships between x and y.
The pos=True argument indicates that the variables are positive.
Make sure to install cvxpy before running the script:

bash
Copy code
pip install cvxpy
You can customize the objective function and constraints based on your specific geometric programming problem. cvxpy will handle the conversion of the geometric programming problem into a standard convex optimization problem and solve it efficiently.

Refer to the cvxpy documentation for more details and advanced usage: https://www.cvxpy.org/
