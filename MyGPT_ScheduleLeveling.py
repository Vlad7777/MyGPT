#MyGPT_ScheduleLeveling

""""
Schedule leveling, also known as resource leveling, aims to distribute resources (such as manpower or machinery) evenly over time to avoid peaks and valleys in resource utilization. This helps in creating a more balanced and realistic schedule. One approach for solving schedule leveling problems is through linear programming or mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Here's an example using the PuLP library in Python:

python
Copy code
"""

from pulp import LpProblem, LpVariable, lpSum, value

# Create a linear programming problem
prob = LpProblem("ScheduleLeveling", LpMinimize)

# Define variables
tasks = ["Task1", "Task2", "Task3"]
time_periods = range(1, 6)  # 5 time periods for this example
assignment = LpVariable.dicts("Assignment", (tasks, time_periods), cat="Binary")

# Define objective function: minimize resource peaks
prob += lpSum(assignment[task][time] for task in tasks for time in time_periods), "ResourcePeaks"

# Define constraints: each task can only be scheduled once
for task in tasks:
    prob += lpSum(assignment[task][time] for time in time_periods) == 1, f"OneTaskPerPeriod_{task}"

# Define constraints: resource leveling
for time in time_periods:
    prob += lpSum(assignment[task][time] for task in tasks) <= 1, f"ResourceLeveling_{time}"

# Solve the optimization problem
prob.solve()

# Print the results
print("Status:", prob.status)
print("Objective Value (Resource Peaks):", value(prob.objective))

# Print the schedule
print("\nOptimal Schedule:")
for time in time_periods:
    scheduled_tasks = [task for task in tasks if value(assignment[task][time]) == 1]
    print(f"Time {time}: {', '.join(scheduled_tasks)}")

    """
In this example, tasks are assigned to time periods with the goal of minimizing resource peaks. The constraints ensure that each task is scheduled only once and that the resource leveling condition is satisfied.

Note: Before running this code, make sure to install the PuLP library using pip install pulp.

For more complex scheduling problems, you might need to consider specialized solvers like Gurobi or explore other optimization techniques depending on the specific requirements of your application.
