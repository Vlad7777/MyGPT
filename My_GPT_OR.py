"""

Operations Research (OR) involves the application of mathematical and analytical methods to decision-making and problem-solving in complex systems. Python provides various libraries and tools that are widely used for Operations Research tasks. Here are some key areas and corresponding libraries in Python:

Linear Programming:
PuLP:

PuLP is a linear programming library in Python for defining and solving linear programming problems.
python
Copy code

"""

from pulp import LpMaximize, LpProblem, LpVariable

# Create a LP maximization problem
model = LpProblem(name="Maximize_Profit", sense=LpMaximize)

# Define decision variables
x = LpVariable(name="x", lowBound=0)
y = LpVariable(name="y", lowBound=0)

# Define the objective function
model += 3 * x + 2 * y, "Total_Profit"

# Define constraints
model += 2 * x + y <= 20
model += 4 * x - 5 * y >= -10

# Solve the optimization problem
model.solve()

"""
Simulation and Optimization:
SimPy:

SimPy is a discrete-event simulation library that can be used for modeling and simulating systems.
python
Copy code
"""


import simpy

# SimPy simulation example
def car(env):
    while True:
        print("Start parking at", env.now)
        parking_duration = 5
        yield env.timeout(parking_duration)

        print("Start driving at", env.now)
        trip_duration = 2
        yield env.timeout(trip_duration)

env = simpy.Environment()
env.process(car(env))
env.run(until=15)

"""
Optimization and Non-linear Programming:
SciPy:

SciPy is a scientific computing library that includes optimization modules for non-linear programming.
python
Copy code
"""

from scipy.optimize import minimize

# SciPy optimization example
def objective(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2

result = minimize(objective, [1, 1], method='SLSQP')
print(result.x)

"""
Queueing Theory:
QueueingTool:

QueueingTool is a library for analyzing queueing models.
python
Copy code
"""

import queueing_tool as qt

# QueueingTool example
arrival_rate = [0.1, 0.2]
service_rate = [0.3, 0.4]
num_servers = [1, 2]

mm1 = qt.QueueNetwork('MM1', arrival_rate, service_rate, num_servers)
mm1.set_max_entities(1000)

mm1.simulate()
mm1.plot_simulation()

"""
Network Optimization:
NetworkX:

NetworkX is a library for the creation, analysis, and visualization of complex networks.
python
Copy code
"""


import networkx as nx

# NetworkX example
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edge('A', 'B', weight=4)
G.add_edge('B', 'C', weight=2)
G.add_edge('A', 'C', weight=1)

shortest_path = nx.shortest_path(G, 'A', 'C', weight='weight')
print(shortest_path)
#These are just a few examples, and the choice of libraries depends on the specific area of Operations Research and the problem at hand. Python's versatility and the availability of various specialized libraries make it a powerful tool for Operations Research tasks.
