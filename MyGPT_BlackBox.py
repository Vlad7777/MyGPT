#MyGPT_BlackBox



#In Python, a "black box" typically refers to a module, function, or piece of code whose internal workings are not visible or important for the user. Users interact with the black box by providing inputs and receiving outputs, without needing to understand the internal implementation details.

#Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept of a black box:


# Black box function
def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

# User interacts with the black box
input_a = 5
input_b = 3

# Calling the black box function
output = add_numbers(input_a, input_b)

# User receives the output without knowing the internal details
print(f"The sum of {input_a} and {input_b} is {output}")


#In this example, add_numbers is a black box function. Users only need to know that it takes two inputs and returns their sum. The internal implementation details of how addition is performed are hidden from the user.

#The concept of black boxes is fundamental in software engineering and modular programming. It allows for abstraction, encapsulation, and separation of concerns, making code more maintainable and easier to understand. Users can focus on using the functionality provided by the black box without worrying about its internal workings.
