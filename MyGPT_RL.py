"""
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a broad field with various algorithms and approaches. One of the popular libraries for implementing RL in Python is OpenAI's Gym. Below is a simple example of a Python program using the Gym library and the Q-learning algorithm to solve the FrozenLake environment. Install the required library first:

bash
Copy code
pip install gym
Here's a basic example:

python
Copy code

"""


import numpy as np
import gym

# Create the FrozenLake environment
env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v1', is_slippery=False)

# Initialize Q-table with zeros
Q = np.zeros([env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n])

# Set hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.8
discount_factor = 0.95
num_episodes = 2000

# Implement Q-learning algorithm
for i in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    total_reward = 0

    while True:
        # Choose an action (epsilon-greedy strategy)
        if np.random.rand() < 0.5:
            action = env.action_space.sample()  # Exploration
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])  # Exploitation

        # Take the chosen action and observe the next state and reward
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        # Update the Q-table using the Q-learning formula
        Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * np.max(Q[next_state, :]) - Q[state, action])

        total_reward += reward
        state = next_state

        if done:
            break

    if i % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Episode {i}, Total Reward: {total_reward}")

# Evaluate the trained agent
total_rewards = 0
num_episodes_eval = 100

for _ in range(num_episodes_eval):
    state = env.reset()
    while True:
        action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        total_rewards += reward
        state = next_state
        if done:
            break

average_reward = total_rewards / num_episodes_eval
print(f"Average Reward over {num_episodes_eval} Evaluation Episodes: {average_reward}")

"""
In this example:

The program uses the FrozenLake environment from Gym, a simple grid world where the agent needs to reach the goal without falling into a hole.
The Q-learning algorithm is implemented to update the Q-table based on the rewards obtained by the agent.
The program prints the total reward for every 100 episodes during training and evaluates the trained agent's performance.
Note: Reinforcement Learning can be quite complex, and the example above is a basic illustration. For more advanced RL tasks, you might need to explore more sophisticated algorithms and techniques.
