"""
Convex optimization with constraints in Python can be achieved using various libraries and techniques. Here's a summary of two popular approaches:

Using SciPy.optimize: SciPy.optimize is a built-in Python library that includes functions for solving convex optimization problems. It provides the minimize function with the method='SLSQP' option, which can handle convex problems with linear constraints.

Using CVXPY: CVXPY is an open-source modeling language and solver toolkit specifically designed for convex optimization. It provides a clear and concise modeling language, allowing you to define convex optimization problems declaratively. CVXPY also integrates with external solvers, such as CPLEX and Gurobi, which can efficiently solve large-scale convex optimization problems with constraints.

Here's an example of how to use SciPy.optimize to solve a simple convex optimization problem with linear constraints:

Python

"""

import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_function(x):
    # Define your objective function here
    return x[0] ** 2 + x[1] ** 2

def constraint_1(x):
    # Define your first constraint here
    return x[0] + 2 * x[1] <= 10

def constraint_2(x):
    # Define your second constraint here
    return 3 * x[0] + x[1] <= 15

def main():
    # Initialize variables
    x0 = [2, 3]  # Initial guess for the solution

    # Define bounds for the variables
    bnds = [(0, 5), (0, 5)]

    # Create constraint functions
    cons = [constraint_1, constraint_2]

    # Solve the optimization problem
    res = minimize(objective_function, x0, method='SLSQP', bounds=bnds, constraints=cons)

    # Print the solution
    print('Solution:')
    print(res.x)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()



#This code will solve a convex optimization problem that minimizes the sum of squares of two variables while satisfying two linear constraints. The SLSQP method is used to solve the optimization problem, and the bounds and constraints parameters are used to specify the bounds for the variables and the constraint functions.
