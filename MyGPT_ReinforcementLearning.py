#MyGPT_ReinforcementLearning

"""
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Python offers several libraries and frameworks for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms. One of the most widely used libraries is TensorFlow with the Keras API, and another popular option is OpenAI Gym. Below, I'll provide a simple example using OpenAI Gym and Q-learning, a classic RL algorithm:


"""

import gym
import numpy as np

# Create the environment
env = gym.make('Taxi-v3')

# Q-learning parameters
alpha = 0.1  # learning rate
gamma = 0.99  # discount factor
epsilon = 0.1  # exploration-exploitation trade-off

# Initialize Q-table
num_states = env.observation_space.n
num_actions = env.action_space.n
Q = np.zeros((num_states, num_actions))

# Q-learning training
num_episodes = 1000
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        # Exploration-exploitation trade-off
        if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
            action = env.action_space.sample()  # explore
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])  # exploit

        # Take the chosen action
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        # Q-value update using the Bellman equation
        Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state, :]) - Q[state, action])

        state = next_state

# Evaluate the trained agent
total_reward = 0
num_episodes_eval = 10
for _ in range(num_episodes_eval):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        total_reward += reward
        state = next_state

average_reward = total_reward / num_episodes_eval
print(f'Average Reward over {num_episodes_eval} episodes: {average_reward}')

# Close the environment
env.close()

"""
In this example:

The environment used is the "Taxi-v3" environment from OpenAI Gym.
The Q-learning algorithm is implemented to learn a Q-table, which represents the expected future rewards for each state-action pair.
The agent explores the environment, updating its Q-values using the Bellman equation.
After training, the agent is evaluated over a number of episodes, and the average reward is calculated.
Note that this is a basic example, and reinforcement learning can become much more complex, especially in more challenging environments. For more advanced RL algorithms and frameworks, consider exploring libraries like TensorFlow's RL (TF-Agents), Stable Baselines, or Ray RLlib.
