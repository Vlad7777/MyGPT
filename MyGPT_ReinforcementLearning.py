"""
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Python has several libraries for implementing RL algorithms. One popular library is OpenAI Gym, which provides a variety of environments for testing and developing RL algorithms.

Here's a simple example of using OpenAI Gym and the Q-learning algorithm for a basic RL task:

python
Copy code
"""

import gym
import numpy as np

# Create the FrozenLake environment
env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v1')

# Initialize Q-table with zeros
num_states = env.observation_space.n
num_actions = env.action_space.n
Q = np.zeros((num_states, num_actions))

# Set hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.8
discount_factor = 0.95
num_episodes = 1000

# Q-learning algorithm
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        # Choose an action using epsilon-greedy policy
        if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < 0.2:
            action = env.action_space.sample()  # Explore
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])  # Exploit

        # Take the chosen action and observe the next state and reward
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        # Update Q-value using the Q-learning update rule
        Q[state, action] = (1 - learning_rate) * Q[state, action] + \
                           learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * np.max(Q[next_state, :]))

        # Move to the next state
        state = next_state

# Evaluate the trained agent
total_rewards = 0
num_episodes_eval = 100

for episode in range(num_episodes_eval):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        total_rewards += reward
        state = next_state

average_reward = total_rewards / num_episodes_eval
print(f"Average reward over {num_episodes_eval} episodes: {average_reward}")

"""
In this example:

We use the FrozenLake environment from OpenAI Gym, where the agent needs to navigate a frozen lake to reach a goal.
The Q-learning algorithm is used to learn a Q-table that represents the expected future rewards for each state-action pair.
The agent's policy is epsilon-greedy, allowing for exploration and exploitation.
Make sure to have OpenAI Gym installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install gym
This is a basic example, and RL can involve more complex algorithms, environments, and techniques. If you want to explore deep reinforcement learning, libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide tools for implementing deep Q-networks (DQN) and other advanced RL algorithms.
