#MyGPT_FiniteStateMachine

#A finite state machine (FSM) is a computational model used to design and describe the behavior of systems with a finite number of states. In Python, you can implement a simple finite state machine using classes and state transitions. Here's a basic example:


class StateMachine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.states = {}
        self.current_state = None

    def add_state(self, name, handler):
        self.states[name] = handler

    def set_state(self, name):
        if name in self.states:
            print(f"Entering state: {name}")
            self.current_state = self.states[name]
            self.current_state()
        else:
            print(f"State {name} not found.")

# Example usage:
def state1():
    print("Inside State 1")

def state2():
    print("Inside State 2")

def state3():
    print("Inside State 3")

# Create an instance of the StateMachine
fsm = StateMachine()

# Add states to the state machine
fsm.add_state("State1", state1)
fsm.add_state("State2", state2)
fsm.add_state("State3", state3)

# Set the initial state
fsm.set_state("State1")

# Transition to other states
fsm.set_state("State2")
fsm.set_state("State3")


#In this example, the StateMachine class has methods to add states (add_state) and set the current state (set_state). States are implemented as functions, and you can define the behavior of each state in its corresponding function (e.g., state1, state2, state3). The set_state method transitions the machine to the specified state.

#This is a simple example, and you can extend it based on your specific requirements. You might want to add events, transitions, and conditions to make the finite state machine more versatile and capable of handling complex scenarios.
