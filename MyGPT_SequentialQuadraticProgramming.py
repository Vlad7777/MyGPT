Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) in Python
ChatGPT
Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is an optimization technique that iteratively solves quadratic programming subproblems to find the optimal solution to a constrained optimization problem. In Python, you can use the scipy.optimize library to implement SQP. Here's an example:

python
Copy code

"""

from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(x):
    return (x[0] - 1)**2 + (x[1] - 2.5)**2

# Define the equality constraint
def equality_constraint(x):
    return x[0] + x[1] - 3

# Define the inequality constraint
def inequality_constraint(x):
    return x[0] - 2 * x[1] + 2

# Initial guess
initial_guess = [0, 0]

# Define the optimization problem
constraints = (
    {'type': 'eq', 'fun': equality_constraint},
    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': inequality_constraint}
)

# Run the SQP optimizer
result = minimize(objective_function, initial_guess, method='SLSQP', constraints=constraints)

# Print the result
print("Optimal solution:", result.x)
print("Optimal objective value:", result.fun)

"""
In this example, we have defined a simple quadratic objective function along with equality and inequality constraints. The minimize function from scipy.optimize is used with the 'SLSQP' method, which stands for Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming.

The constraints are specified using the constraints argument, where each constraint is a dictionary with the keys 'type' and 'fun'. 'type' can be 'eq' for equality constraints or 'ineq' for inequality constraints, and 'fun' is the function representing the constraint.

Make sure to replace the objective function and constraints with your specific problem's functions. Additionally, you might need to adjust the initial guess and other parameters based on your optimization problem.
