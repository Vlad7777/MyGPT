"""
Convex analysis is a branch of mathematics focused on studying convex sets and convex functions. In Python, you can perform convex analysis using libraries like cvxpy or scipy. Here's a basic example using cvxpy to solve a convex optimization problem:

python
Copy code

"""


import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# Define the variables
x = cp.Variable()
y = cp.Variable()

# Define the objective function
objective = cp.Minimize(x**2 + y**2)

# Define the constraints
constraints = [x + y >= 1]

# Formulate the problem
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

# Solve the problem
problem.solve()

# Display the results
print(f"Optimal value of x: {x.value}")
print(f"Optimal value of y: {y.value}")
print(f"Optimal objective value: {problem.value}")

"""
In this example:

We define variables x and y.
The objective function is to minimize x^2 + y^2.
There is a constraint x + y >= 1.
The problem is formulated and solved using cvxpy.
Make sure to have cvxpy installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install cvxpy
This is a simple example, and you can extend it to more complex convex optimization problems with additional variables and constraints.

If you have a specific convex analysis problem in mind, you may need to adapt the approach based on the nature of your problem. The scipy.optimize module also provides optimization functions that support convex optimization, and you can choose the appropriate method based on your problem's characteristics.
