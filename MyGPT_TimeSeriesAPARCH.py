#MyGPT_TimeSeriesAPARCH

"""
In Python, you can use the arch library to fit an Autoregressive Power ARCH (APARCH) model, which is an extension of the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. The arch library provides a convenient interface for estimating various volatility models, including APARCH.

Here's an example of how to use the arch library to fit an APARCH(1, 1) model to a financial time series:
"""

# Install the 'arch' library if you haven't already
# pip install arch

import pandas as pd
from arch import arch_model
import yfinance as yf  # You can replace this with any other method to get financial time series data

# Download historical stock prices
ticker = 'AAPL'
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2023-01-01'
data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)['Adj Close']

# Calculate daily returns
returns = data.pct_change().dropna()

# Fit an APARCH(1,1) model
model = arch_model(returns, vol='aparch', p=1, o=1, q=1)
results = model.fit()

# Display model summary
print(results.summary())

# Plot the volatility forecast
results.plot()


"""
In this example:

We use the yfinance library to download historical stock prices for a given ticker symbol ('AAPL') within a specified date range.

Calculate daily returns from the adjusted closing prices.

Fit an APARCH(1, 1) model using the arch_model function from the arch library.

Display the summary of the model results using results.summary().

Plot the volatility forecast using results.plot().

Make sure to replace 'AAPL' with the desired ticker symbol and adjust the date range as needed. Additionally, you can experiment with different APARCH specifications (changing p, o, and q parameters) based on the characteristics of your data.
