"""
Multi-objective optimization deals with problems where there are multiple conflicting objectives to be optimized simultaneously. Python provides several libraries and tools for multi-objective optimization. One popular library is pymoo. Below is a simple example using pymoo for solving a multi-objective optimization problem:

python
Copy code

"""

from pymoo.algorithms.nsga2 import NSGA2
from pymoo.factory import get_problem
from pymoo.optimize import minimize
from pymoo.visualization.scatter import Scatter

# Define the multi-objective optimization problem
problem = get_problem("zdt1")

# Define the algorithm (NSGA-II in this case)
algorithm = NSGA2(pop_size=100)

# Solve the optimization problem
result = minimize(problem, algorithm, ('n_gen', 100), seed=1, verbose=True)

# Plot the Pareto front
Scatter().add(result.F).show()

"""
In this example:

We use the get_problem function from pymoo.factory to choose a multi-objective optimization problem. "zdt1" is one of the built-in test problems.
The NSGA-II algorithm is chosen as the multi-objective optimization algorithm.
The minimize function is used to perform the optimization.
Finally, a scatter plot of the Pareto front is generated using Scatter().
Make sure to have pymoo installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pymoo
You can customize this example for your specific multi-objective optimization problem by defining your own problem using the pymoo.core.problem module and selecting an appropriate algorithm from pymoo.algorithms. pymoo provides various algorithms, metrics, and visualizations for multi-objective optimization.
