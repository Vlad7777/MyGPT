"""
The Assignment Problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the optimal assignment of a set of tasks to a set of agents in a way that minimizes the total cost. The scipy library in Python provides a function for solving the assignment problem using the Hungarian algorithm.

Here's a basic example:

python
Copy code

"""
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment

# Create a cost matrix (replace this with your actual cost matrix)
cost_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                       [4, 5, 6],
                       [7, 8, 9]])

# Solve the assignment problem using the Hungarian algorithm
row_indices, col_indices = linear_sum_assignment(cost_matrix)

# Print the optimal assignment
print("Optimal Assignment:")
for i, j in zip(row_indices, col_indices):
    print(f"Task {i + 1} is assigned to Agent {j + 1} with cost {cost_matrix[i, j]}")

# Print the total cost of the optimal assignment
total_cost = cost_matrix[row_indices, col_indices].sum()
print(f"Total Cost: {total_cost}")

"""
In this example:

The linear_sum_assignment function from scipy.optimize is used to solve the assignment problem.
The cost matrix represents the cost of assigning each task to each agent. You should replace it with your actual cost matrix.
Make sure to install scipy before running the code:

bash
Copy code
pip install scipy
This example assumes that the number of tasks is equal to the number of agents. If the numbers are different, you may need to add dummy tasks or agents with high costs to balance the problem.

Adjust the cost matrix to reflect your specific assignment problem, and the code will find the optimal assignment based on the minimum total cost.
