"""
Stochastic programming deals with optimization problems where some of the parameters are uncertain and modeled as random variables. One popular library for handling stochastic programming in Python is Pyomo. It's a powerful optimization library that supports various optimization problem formulations, including stochastic programming.

Here's a basic example of a two-stage stochastic linear programming problem using Pyomo:

python
Copy code
"""

from pyomo.environ import ConcreteModel, Var, Objective, Constraint, NonNegativeReals, Binary
from pyomo.environ import SolverFactory, ConstraintList
from random import uniform

# Generate random data for the problem
num_scenarios = 3
demand_scenarios = [uniform(80, 120) for _ in range(num_scenarios)]

# Create a Concrete Model
model = ConcreteModel()

# Sets
model.Stages = range(2)  # 0 for first stage, 1 for second stage
model.Scenarios = range(num_scenarios)

# Variables
model.Quantity = Var(model.Stages, model.Scenarios, within=NonNegativeReals)
model.Decision = Var(within=Binary)

# Objective function
model.obj = Objective(expr=sum(model.Decision * model.Quantity[0, s] for s in model.Scenarios),
                      sense=-1)

# Constraints
model.stage1_constraint = Constraint(expr=sum(model.Quantity[0, s] for s in model.Scenarios) >= 100)
model.stage2_constraint = ConstraintList()
for s in model.Scenarios:
    model.stage2_constraint.add(expr=model.Quantity[1, s] == demand_scenarios[s])
model.stage2_decision_constraint = Constraint(expr=model.Decision * num_scenarios >= 1)

# Solve the stochastic programming problem
solver = SolverFactory('glpk')
solver.solve(model)

# Display the results
print("Decision Variable:", model.Decision())
print("Optimal First-Stage Quantities:")
for s in model.Scenarios:
    print(f"Scenario {s + 1}: {model.Quantity[0, s]()}")

print("Objective Value:", -model.obj())

"""
In this example:

We consider a two-stage stochastic linear programming problem.
The first stage has a decision variable (binary) representing whether to make a commitment.
The second stage has a constraint representing the demand, which is scenario-dependent.
The objective is to minimize the expected cost.
Before running this code, make sure to install Pyomo:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyomo
This is a simplified example, and Pyomo supports more complex stochastic programming formulations with different solvers and additional features. You can adapt this code based on your specific stochastic programming problem.
