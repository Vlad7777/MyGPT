"""
Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a mathematical optimization technique where the objective function and constraints are linear, and some of the variables are restricted to integer values. Python provides several libraries for solving MILP problems, and one popular choice is PuLP. PuLP is an open-source linear programming library for Python.

Here's a basic example of solving a MILP problem using PuLP:

python
Copy code

"""

from pulp import LpProblem, LpVariable, lpSum, LpMaximize

# Create a MILP problem
problem = LpProblem("MILP Example", LpMaximize)

# Define variables
x1 = LpVariable("x1", lowBound=0, cat="Integer")
x2 = LpVariable("x2", lowBound=0, cat="Integer")

# Define the objective function
problem += 3 * x1 + 2 * x2, "Objective"

# Define constraints
problem += 2 * x1 + x2 <= 10, "Constraint1"
problem += 4 * x1 - 5 * x2 >= -5, "Constraint2"
problem += x1 + 2 * x2 == 7, "Constraint3"

# Solve the problem
problem.solve()

# Print the results
print("Status:", problem.status)
print("Objective Value:", round(problem.objective.value(), 2))
print("Variable Values:")
for v in problem.variables():
    print(f"{v.name} = {round(v.varValue, 2)}")

"""
In this example, we create a MILP problem using PuLP, define variables (x1 and x2), set up the objective function and constraints, and then solve the problem using the solve() method. Finally, we print the status, objective value, and variable values.

You can install PuLP using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pulp
Remember to consult the PuLP documentation for more advanced features and options: https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/. Additionally, other optimization libraries, such as Gurobi and CPLEX, are also available for more complex MILP problems.
