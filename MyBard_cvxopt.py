Here are some examples of how to use cvxopt 1.3.2 in Python:

Solving a linear programming (LP) problem

Python

"""
import numpy as np
import cvxopt as opt

# Define the problem data
c = np.array([2, 1])  # Objective function coefficients
A = np.array([[1, 1], [3, 2]])  # Constraint matrix
b = np.array([5, 4])  # Right-hand side values of the constraints

# Create a cvxopt problem
prob = opt.Problem(opt.Maximize(c @ opt.matrix(x)), [A @ opt.matrix(x) <= b])

# Solve the problem
sol = prob.solve()

# Print the solution
print('Solution:')
print(sol['x'])

"""

This code will solve the LP problem of maximizing the objective function 2x1 + x2 subject to the constraints x1 + 2x2 <= 5 and 3x1 + 2x2 <= 4. The solve() method will return the optimal solution, which is stored in the sol dictionary.

Solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem

Python

"""
import cvxopt as opt

# Define the problem data
Q = np.array([[2, 1], [1, 3]])  # Hessian matrix of the objective function
c = np.array([2, 1])  # Gradient vector of the objective function
A = np.array([[1, 1]])  # Matrix of constraint coefficients
b = np.array([3])  # Vector of constraint values

# Create a cvxopt problem
prob = opt.Problem(opt.Maximize(0.5 * np.dot(x, np.dot(Q, x)) + np.dot(c, x)), [A @ opt.matrix(x) == b])

# Solve the problem
sol = prob.solve()

# Print the solution
print('Solution:')
print(sol['x'])

"""

This code will solve the QP problem of maximizing the objective function 0.5 * (2x1^2 + 3x2^2) + 2x1 + x2 subject to the constraint x1 + x2 = 3. The solve() method will return the optimal solution, which is stored in the sol dictionary.

Solving a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem



"""
import cvxopt as opt

# Define the problem data
G = np.array([[[1, 0], [1, 1]], [[0, 0], [-1, 2]]])  # Second-order cone matrix
h = np.array([1, 3])  # Second-order cone values
A = np.array([[1, 1], [3, 2]])  # Constraint matrix
b = np.array([5, 4])  # Right-hand side values of the constraints

# Create a cvxopt problem
prob = opt.Problem(opt.Maximize(0.5 * np.dot(x, np.dot(Q, x)) + np.dot(c, x)), [A @ opt.matrix(x) <= b, G @ opt.matrix(x) <= h])

# Solve the problem
sol = prob.solve()

# Print the solution
print('Solution:')
print(sol['x'])

"""

This code will solve the SOCP problem of maximizing the objective function 0.5 * (2x1^2 + 3x2^2) + 2x1 + x2 subject to the constraints x1 + 2x2 <= 5, 0 <= x1^2 + x2^2 <= 9, and 3x1 + 2x2 <= 4. The solve() method will return the optimal solution, which is stored in the sol dictionary.
