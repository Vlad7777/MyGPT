#MyGPT_DifferentialEvolution

"""
Differential Evolution (DE) is an evolutionary optimization algorithm that is particularly useful for solving global optimization problems. In Python, you can use the scipy.optimize library, which provides an implementation of DE through the differential_evolution function. Here's a simple example:

python
"""


from scipy.optimize import differential_evolution

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(x):
    return (x[0] - 1)**2 + (x[1] - 2.5)**2

# Define the bounds for each parameter
bounds = [(-5, 5), (-5, 5)]

# Run the differential evolution optimizer
result = differential_evolution(objective_function, bounds)

# Print the result
print("Optimal solution:", result.x)
print("Optimal objective value:", result.fun)

"""
In this example, the objective_function represents the function to be minimized. The bounds variable specifies the search space for each parameter. The differential_evolution function is then called with the objective function and bounds.

You can also include constraints using the constraints parameter:

python
"""


from scipy.optimize import differential_evolution

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(x):
    return (x[0] - 1)**2 + (x[1] - 2.5)**2

# Define the equality constraint
def equality_constraint(x):
    return x[0] + x[1] - 3

# Define the inequality constraint
def inequality_constraint(x):
    return x[0] - 2 * x[1] + 2

# Define the bounds for each parameter
bounds = [(-5, 5), (-5, 5)]

# Define the constraints
constraints = [{'type': 'eq', 'fun': equality_constraint}, {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': inequality_constraint}]

# Run the differential evolution optimizer with constraints
result = differential_evolution(objective_function, bounds, constraints=constraints)

# Print the result
print("Optimal solution:", result.x)
print("Optimal objective value:", result.fun)

""""""
Here, the constraints are specified in the form of dictionaries with keys 'type' and 'fun' to indicate the type of constraint (equality or inequality) and the constraint function, respectively.

Adjust the objective function, constraints, bounds, and other parameters based on your specific optimization problem. The differential_evolution function provides various optional parameters for fine-tuning the algorithm's behavior, such as population size, mutation, and crossover parameters.
