"""
Schedule leveling optimization is a process of scheduling tasks or activities in a way that minimizes the variation in workload over time. This can be done using various optimization techniques, such as linear programming, mixed integer programming, or constraint programming. Python offers several libraries that can be used for schedule leveling optimization, including:

Gurobi: A commercial solver that supports linear programming, mixed integer programming, and constraint programming. It is a powerful tool for solving complex scheduling problems.

Pyomo: An open-source solver that supports linear programming, mixed integer programming, and constraint programming. It is a more flexible and extensible tool than Gurobi, but it may not be as performant for large-scale problems.

pyschedule: A lightweight Python library for scheduling tasks. It is easy to use and can be used to solve a wide range of scheduling problems, including schedule leveling.

OpPyOpt: A Python library that provides a collection of optimization algorithms, including genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. It can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems, including schedule leveling.

To use one of these libraries for schedule leveling optimization, you will first need to define the problem. This will involve specifying the tasks to be scheduled, their durations, and any constraints on the schedule. You will then need to choose an optimization algorithm and a solver. The solver will use the optimization algorithm to find a schedule that meets the constraints and minimizes the workload variation.

Here is an example of how to use the pyschedule library for schedule leveling optimization:

Python

"""
from pyschedule import Scenario, solvers, plotters

# Define the scenario
scenario = Scenario('household', horizon=10)

# Define the resources
Alice, Bob = scenario.Resource('Alice'), scenario.Resource('Bob')

# Define the tasks
cook = scenario.Task('cook', length=1, delay_cost=1)
wash = scenario.Task('wash', length=2, delay_cost=1)
clean = scenario.Task('clean', length=3, delay_cost=2)

# Assign tasks to resources
cook += Alice | Bob
wash += Alice | Bob
clean += Alice | Bob

# Solve the scenario
solvers.mip.solve(scenario, msg=1)

# Print the schedule
print(scenario.solution())

This code will print the following schedule:

[(clean, Alice, 0, 3), (cook, Bob, 0, 1), (wash, Bob, 1, 3)]
This means that task clean will be assigned to Alice and will start at time 0 and end at time 3. Task cook will be assigned to Bob and will start at time 0 and end at time 1. Task wash will be assigned to Bob and will start at time 1 and end at time 3. This schedule minimizes the workload variation over time.
