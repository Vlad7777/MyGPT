"""
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a statistical method used to compare two versions of a variable to determine which one performs better. In the context of web development, it's often used to compare the performance of two web pages by measuring the conversion rates.

Here's a simple example of A/B testing in Python using the scipy.stats library:

python
Copy code

"""

import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Generate example data for two groups (A and B)
np.random.seed(42)

group_A = np.random.normal(loc=25, scale=5, size=100)
group_B = np.random.normal(loc=28, scale=5, size=100)

# Perform independent two-sample t-test
statistic, p_value = ttest_ind(group_A, group_B)

# Print the results
print(f'T-Test Statistic: {statistic}')
print(f'P-value: {p_value}')

# Interpret the results
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference between group A and group B.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference between group A and group B.")

"""
In this example:

group_A and group_B represent the conversion rates or other relevant metrics for two versions (A and B).
The independent two-sample t-test is performed using ttest_ind from scipy.stats.
The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the two groups.
Remember to replace the example data with your actual data. Ensure that your sample sizes are representative, and the assumptions of the t-test are met (e.g., normality, homogeneity of variances).

If you're conducting A/B testing in a real-world scenario, you might want to use specialized tools or platforms that provide additional features for experiment design, randomization, and result analysis. Examples include Google Optimize, Optimizely, and others depending on your specific needs.
