#MyGemini_TransportationProblem

"""
The transportation problem is a classic optimization problem in operations research that deals with finding an optimal way to transport goods from a set of origins to a set of destinations. It is often used to model real-world problems such as shipping goods from factories to warehouses or distributing products from warehouses to retailers.

The transportation problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem, which can be solved using a variety of optimization algorithms. One popular library for solving linear programming problems in Python is PuLP.

Here is an example of how to solve a transportation problem using PuLP:

"""

import pulp

# Create the transportation problem
prob = pulp.LpProblem("Transportation", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Define the decision variables
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", [(i, j) for i in origins for j in destinations], 0, None)

# Define the objective function
obj = pulp.lpSum([cost[i, j] * x[i, j] for i in origins for j in destinations])
prob.setObjective(obj, sense=pulp.LpMinimize)

# Define the supply and demand constraints
for i in origins:
    prob += pulp.lpSum(x[i, j] for j in destinations) == supply[i]

for j in destinations:
    prob += pulp.lpSum(x[i, j] for i in origins) == demand[j]

# Solve the problem
prob.solve()

# Print the solution
for i in origins:
    for j in destinations:
        print(f"{i} to {j}: {x[i, j].value()}")

"""       
This code will solve the transportation problem for the following example:

Origins	Destinations	Supply	Demand
North	East	West	100	60	40
South	East	West	50	80	70
The cost of shipping one unit of goods from an origin to a destination is shown in the table below:

Origins	Destinations	Cost
North	East	6
North	West	8
South	East	7
South	West	9
The optimal solution for this problem is to ship 30 units of goods from North to East, 20 units of goods from North to West, 20 units of goods from South to East, and 40 units of goods from South to West. This will minimize the total transportation cost of 1,920.

In addition to PuLP, there are a number of other libraries for solving linear programming problems in Python. Some of the most popular libraries include CVXPY, CVXOPT, and SCIP.
