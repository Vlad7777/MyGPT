"""
Game theory is a mathematical framework for modeling and analyzing strategic interactions between rational decision-makers. Python has libraries, such as nashpy and Gambit, that can be used to work with game theory concepts and solve various types of games.

Here's a basic example using the nashpy library for solving a simple two-player symmetric game:

python
Copy code
"""


import nashpy as nash

# Define the payoff matrix for Player 1
player1_payoffs = [[3, 0], [5, 1]]

# Create the game using the payoff matrices
game = nash.Game(player1_payoffs)

# Find the Nash equilibrium
equilibria = game.support_enumeration()
equilibria_list = list(equilibria)

# Print the Nash equilibria
print("Nash Equilibria:")
for eq in equilibria_list:
    print(f"Player 1 strategy: {eq[0]}, Player 2 strategy: {eq[1]}")

    """
In this example:

The payoff matrix for Player 1 is defined as player1_payoffs.
The nash.Game class is used to create the game with the payoff matrices.
The support_enumeration method is used to find all Nash equilibria.
Make sure to have nashpy installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install nashpy
You can adapt this example to more complex games and scenarios. The nashpy library supports various types of games, including symmetric and asymmetric, cooperative and non-cooperative, and mixed strategies.

Additionally, if you are working with extensive-form games, you might consider libraries like Gambit which provides tools for the manipulation of game trees and the computation of solution concepts:

python
Copy code

"""

import gambit

# Define an extensive-form game
efg = gambit.Game.new_tree()

# ... (Add nodes, players, and strategies to the extensive-form game)

# Solve the extensive-form game for Nash equilibria
solver = gambit.nash.ExternalSolver()
solver.quiet(True)
equilibria = solver.solve(efg)

# Print the Nash equilibria
print("Nash Equilibria:")
for eq in equilibria:
    print(eq)

    """
Make sure to have gambit installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install gambit
Keep in mind that game theory is a broad field, and the appropriate library may depend on the type of game and analysis you are interested in.
