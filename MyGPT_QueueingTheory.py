#MyGPT_QueueingTheory

"""
Queueing theory is the study of queues or waiting lines, which are essential in various systems such as telecommunications, computer systems, transportation, and more. Python has several libraries that can be used for queueing theory simulations and analysis. One popular library is SimPy, a process-based discrete-event simulation library.

Here's a simple example of a queueing system simulation using SimPy:

python
Copy code
"""

import simpy
import random

# Define the queueing system
def customer(env, name, service_time, counter):
    arrival_time = env.now
    print(f"{name} arrives at time {arrival_time}")

    with counter.request() as req:
        yield req
        service_start_time = env.now
        print(f"{name} starts being served at time {service_start_time}")

        yield env.timeout(service_time)

        service_end_time = env.now
        print(f"{name} leaves at time {service_end_time}")
        print(f"{name} spent {service_end_time - arrival_time} units in the system")

# Simulate the queueing system
def simulate_queue(env, num_customers, service_time, interarrival_time):
    counter = simpy.Resource(env, capacity=1)

    for i in range(num_customers):
        env.process(customer(env, f'Customer-{i}', service_time, counter))
        yield env.timeout(interarrival_time)

# Run the simulation
random.seed(42)
env = simpy.Environment()
env.process(simulate_queue(env, num_customers=5, service_time=2, interarrival_time=1))

env.run()

"""
In this example:

SimPy is used to simulate a simple queueing system with one server (counter).
Customers arrive at the system following an exponential interarrival time distribution.
Each customer requires a fixed service time at the counter.
Make sure to have SimPy installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install simpy
You can customize this example by adjusting parameters like the number of customers, service time distribution, or interarrival time distribution based on your specific queueing system. Additionally, SimPy provides more advanced features for modeling complex queueing scenarios.
