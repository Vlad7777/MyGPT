#MyGPT_InteriorPointMethods

"""
Interior-point methods are optimization algorithms used to solve linear and nonlinear constrained optimization problems. The scipy.optimize library in Python provides an implementation of an interior-point method for constrained optimization. The 'trust-constr' method in scipy.optimize.minimize supports interior-point methods.

Here's an example of how you can use the interior-point method in Python:

python
"""

from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the objective function
def objective_function(x):
    return (x[0] - 1)**2 + (x[1] - 2.5)**2

# Define the equality constraint
def equality_constraint(x):
    return x[0] + x[1] - 3

# Define the inequality constraint
def inequality_constraint(x):
    return x[0] - 2 * x[1] + 2

# Initial guess
initial_guess = [0, 0]

# Define the optimization problem
constraints = (
    {'type': 'eq', 'fun': equality_constraint},
    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': inequality_constraint}
)

# Run the interior-point optimizer
result = minimize(objective_function, initial_guess, method='trust-constr', constraints=constraints)

# Print the result
print("Optimal solution:", result.x)
print("Optimal objective value:", result.fun)

"""
In this example, we've used the same objective function and constraints as in the SQP example. The 'trust-constr' method is chosen to perform the optimization using an interior-point method. The constraints are specified similarly to the SQP example, with dictionaries representing equality and inequality constraints.

As with any optimization problem, you may need to customize the objective function, constraints, initial guess, and other parameters based on your specific problem. Interior-point methods are particularly useful for large-scale linear and nonlinear optimization problems with equality and inequality constraints.
