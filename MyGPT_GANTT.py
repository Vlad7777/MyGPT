#MyGPT_GANTT

#Creating Gantt charts in Python can be done using various libraries, and one popular choice is plotly. Here's a simple example of how you can create a Gantt chart using plotly:


# Install the 'plotly' library if you haven't already
# pip install plotly

import pandas as pd

import plotly.express as px

# Create a DataFrame with Gantt chart data
data = [
    dict(Task="Task 1", Start='2023-01-01', Finish='2023-01-10'),
    dict(Task="Task 2", Start='2023-01-05', Finish='2023-01-15'),
    dict(Task="Task 3", Start='2023-01-12', Finish='2023-02-05'),
]

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create Gantt chart using plotly
fig = px.timeline(df, x_start="Start", x_end="Finish", y="Task", title="Gantt Chart")
fig.update_yaxes(categoryorder="total ascending")  # Adjust task order if needed
fig.show()

"""
In this example:

Install the plotly library using pip install plotly if you haven't already.

Create a DataFrame with task data, including the task name, start date, and finish date.

Use the plotly.express.timeline function to create the Gantt chart, specifying the start and finish dates along with the task names.

Adjust the categoryorder in the y-axis if you need to control the order of tasks.

Display the chart using fig.show().

Remember to customize the task data according to your specific needs. You can also explore other libraries like matplotlib or seaborn for Gantt chart creation in Python depending on your preferences and requirements.
