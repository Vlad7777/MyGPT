"""
Decision analysis involves making decisions in the face of uncertainty by considering different possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. Python can be used for decision analysis through various libraries, and one common approach is to use decision trees or decision analysis frameworks.

Here's an example using the scikit-learn library to create a decision tree for decision analysis:

python
Copy code
"""


from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample dataset
data = {
    'Weather': ['Sunny', 'Overcast', 'Rainy', 'Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Overcast', 'Rainy', 'Rainy', 'Sunny', 'Rainy'],
    'Temperature': ['Hot', 'Cool', 'Mild', 'Hot', 'Mild', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'Mild', 'Mild', 'Hot'],
    'Play': ['No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df[['Weather', 'Temperature']])

# Combine numerical features with target variable
X = pd.concat([df_encoded, df['Play']], axis=1)

# Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y)
y = X['Play']
X = X.drop('Play', axis=1)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a decision tree classifier
decision_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)

# Train the classifier on the training data
decision_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = decision_tree.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the classifier
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Display classification report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

"""
In this example:

We use a dataset with weather conditions, temperature, and a decision to play or not.
The categorical variables (Weather and Temperature) are converted to numerical using one-hot encoding.
A decision tree classifier is created and trained on the training data.
Predictions are made on the test data, and accuracy is calculated.
Make sure to have scikit-learn installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install scikit-learn
This is a simple illustration, and decision analysis can involve more complex decision trees, utility functions, and considerations of uncertainty. Depending on your specific needs, you may explore other decision analysis methods and libraries in Python.
