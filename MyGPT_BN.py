"""
Bayesian Networks, also known as Belief Networks or Bayesian Networks, are probabilistic graphical models that represent a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Python, you can use the pgmpy library for working with Bayesian Networks. Below is a simple example:

First, install the pgmpy library:

bash
Copy code

pip install pgmpy
Now, let's create a basic Bayesian Network using pgmpy:

python
Copy code
"""

from pgmpy.models import BayesianModel
from pgmpy.estimators import ParameterEstimator
from pgmpy.inference import VariableElimination

# Create a Bayesian Network
model = BayesianModel([('D', 'G'), ('I', 'G'), ('G', 'L'), ('I', 'S')])

# Generate some example data
data = {
    'D': [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    'I': [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    'G': [1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    'L': [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    'S': [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
}

# Fit the model with the example data
model.fit(data, estimator=ParameterEstimator)

# Perform variable elimination for inference
inference = VariableElimination(model)

# Calculate the probability of Smokes given evidence of Difficulty and Grade
result = inference.query(variables=['S'], evidence={'D': 1, 'G': 0})
print(result)

"""
In this example:

We create a Bayesian Network structure using the BayesianModel class from pgmpy.
Example data is generated for the variables ('D', 'I', 'G', 'L', 'S').
The model is fitted to the example data using parameter estimation (ParameterEstimator).
Variable elimination (VariableElimination) is used for probabilistic inference.
The printed result will show the probability distribution of 'S' (Smokes) given evidence of 'D' (Difficulty) being 1 and 'G' (Grade) being 0.

pgmpy supports other functionalities such as structure learning, parameter learning, and various inference algorithms. You can adapt the code based on your specific Bayesian Network and use case.

Note: Bayesian Networks can become more complex with a larger number of nodes and dependencies. Ensure that you have enough data for accurate parameter estimation and inference.
