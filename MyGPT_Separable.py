#MyGPT_Separable

"""
Separable programming is a type of mathematical optimization problem where the objective function is the sum of separate functions of individual variables. Python provides various optimization libraries that can be used for separable programming. Here's a basic example using scipy.optimize:

python
Copy code
"""

from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define the separate objective functions
def f1(x):
    return x[0]**2

def f2(x):
    return (x[1] - 1)**2

# Define the overall objective function (sum of separate functions)
def objective(x):
    return f1(x) + f2(x)

# Initial guess
x0 = [0, 0]

# Solve the optimization problem
result = minimize(objective, x0, method='BFGS')

# Display the results
print("Optimal values of x:", result.x)
print("Optimal objective value:", result.fun)

"""
In this example:

We define two separate objective functions f1 and f2.
The overall objective function is the sum of f1 and f2.
The minimize function from scipy.optimize is used to find the optimal values of x that minimize the overall objective function.
Make sure to have scipy installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install scipy
You can customize this example based on your specific separable programming problem and the characteristics of your objective functions. Depending on the size and complexity of your problem, you might explore other optimization libraries and algorithms that are suitable for separable programming.
